# FullStackWebApps

So far the idea is this: 
Have a kitchen helper app that lets users input the ingredients and quantity of them (with a easy to navigate UI to provide convenient selections from drop downs and searching autosuggestions). 
-It will go through a database of recipes with ingredients and provide matches based on what's in the fridge. 
-Hoping to maybe use some AI algorithm to have updated recommendations based on the user's tastes and past history. 
-They have to create an account in order to use the app and it links to their social media pages to post recipes and pictures. Users will have a basic profile not just with username and password but also description information such as About Me so that they can connect with other users with similar tastes. There will be a minimalistic social media setting with short status updates and video uploads.
-The use of cooking substitutions will be implemented based on users' approval according to popularity. 
-Will have a grocery list option with suggestions offered once ingredients get low according to frequency of use.
-Navigates smoothly from PC to mobile.

For any other suggestions, message me.
